Requirements Specification
    Customer must be able to enter the interest rate, investment amount, monthly payment amount,
    and number of years.
    The results must be easy to understand and read.
    The software will take that information and calculate the future value of that investment.

System Analysis
    The user inputs the interest rate, investment rate, investment amount, monthly payment amount, and number of
    years that they will be paying that rate.
    The program will take that information and put it through this formula, futureValue = investedAmount * (1 + monthlyInterestRate)
    **numberOfMonths + paymentAmount * (monthlyInterestRate)**numberOfMonths - 1/ monthlyInterestRate * (1 + monthlyInterestRate)
    The program will then display the Future Value of the investment.

System Design
    Define the interest rate, investment rate, investment amount, monthly payment amount, and number of years, using \
    these variables, investedAmount, monthlyInterestRate, paymentAmount, and numberOfYears
    translate the numberOfYears to numberOfMonths
    Create a variable futureValue
    run the variables through this formula futureValue = investedAmount * (1 + monthlyInterestRate)
    **numberOfMonths + paymentAmount * (monthlyInterestRate)**numberOfMonths - 1/ monthlyInterestRate * (1 + monthlyInterestRate)
    Print futureValue
