Requirement Specification
    The user will input coordinates for a point on a turtle drawn target.
    The program will draw in a dot at that coordinate.

System Analysis
    The system will create a target with 4 circles that are the radius of the center circle apart set at 0,0
    THe user will then input coordinates
    the program will move to those coordinates and put a white circle in that point

system design
    start by defining the radius of the center circle
    create the inner circle with the radius variable
    add the length of the radius to the radius variable
    create a circle using the radius variable
    add the length of the middle radius to the variable
    create a circle using the radius variable
    add the length of the middle radius to the variable
    create a circle using the radius variable

    create xPos variable and yPos using input from the user
    goto those points
    and draw a circle at that point

Testing

Test 1:
    Input (5, 7)
    output (5. 7)

Test 2:
    Input (20, 30
    output (20, 30)
